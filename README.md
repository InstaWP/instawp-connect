Create a staging WordPress site from production (live site). Ideal for testing updates, version change or re-write. Sync back only the changes.

InstaWP Connect is a [WordPress staging](https://instawp.com/wordpress-staging/) and migration plugin developed by the InstaWP team. It works as a companion tool for InstaWP - a famous tool for creating WordPress websites to test plugin or theme, product demo creation, client project delivery, and everything that can improve your WordPress workflows.

The aim of this plugin is to speed up your WordPress staging process and complete it in seconds without you putting in any effort.

Once you activate InstaWP Connect, you can click Create Site and connect your site to your InstaWP account. Once it’s connected, you can select to:

- Create quick staging [media folder will not be copied over].
- Create custom staging [skip plugins, themes, media, or any specific files or folders]
- Create full staging [everything from your live site will be added to the staging site]

One-click, and the staging creation process will begin!

Once the process is complete (it takes a few minutes depending on the site’s size), you will be able to find the staging of your live site in the InstaWP dashboard. Now, it’s possible to test, develop, edit, clone, migrate, or log in to your [staging site](https://instawp.com/wordpress-staging/) in seconds.
